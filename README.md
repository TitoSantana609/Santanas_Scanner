# Santanas_Scanner
This is a python based web scanner
The scanner is a GUI that inputs domain you specify, then does an Amass enum -d scan on that domain. Then it makes an HTTP request to the subdomains found, in order to find alive domains. Then it displays all the alive subdomains in a seperate box.
